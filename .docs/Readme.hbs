# [DEMO](https://mljs.github.io/libsvm/)

Port of to port libsvm v3.22 using [emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten) , for usage in the browser or nodejs.

What is libsvm?
libsvm is a [c++ library](https://github.com/cjlin1/libsvm) developped by Chih-Chung Chang and Chih-Jen Lin that allows to do support vector machine (aka SVM) classification and regression.

# Usage
## Install
```bash
npm install libsvm-js
```

## Load
The main entry point loads the WebAssembly build and is asynchronous.
```js
require('libsvm-js').then(SVM => {
    const svm = new SVM(); // ...
});
```

## Load in a web browser
The npm package contains a bundle for the browser that works with AMD and browser globals. They are located in the `dist/browser` directory of the package. You can load them into your web page with a `script` tag. For the web assembly module, make sure that the libsvm.wasm file is served from the same relative path as the js file.

## Basic usage
This example illustrates how to use the library to train and use an SVM classifier.
```js

async function xor() {
    const SVM = await
    require('libsvm-js');
    const svm = new SVM({
        kernel: SVM.KERNEL_TYPES.RBF, // The type of kernel I want to use
        type: SVM.SVM_TYPES.C_SVC,    // The type of SVM I want to run
        gamma: 1,                     // RBF kernel gamma parameter
        cost: 1                       // C_SVC cost parameter
    });

    // This is the xor problem
    //
    //  1  0
    //  0  1
    const features = [[0, 0], [1, 1], [1, 0], [0, 1]];
    const labels = [0, 0, 1, 1];
    svm.train(features, labels);  // train the model
    const predictedLabel = svm.predictOne([0.7, 0.8]);
    console.log(predictedLabel) // 0
}

xor().then(() => console.log('done!'));
```

# Benchmarks
You can compare the performance of the library in various environments. Run `npm run benchmark` to run the benchmarks with native c/c++ code and with the compiled code with your local version of node.js. For browser performance, go to the [web benchmark page](https://mljs.github.io/libsvm/#benchmarks).

Speed is mainly affected by the javascript engine that compiles it. Since WebAssembly has been stabilized and is an optimization phase, more recent engines are almost always faster.

Speed is also affected by the version of emscripten that generated the build or the options used in the build. I will try to keep up with any improvement that might significantly impact the performance.

## Cross-validation benchmark
There is a benchmark on the iris dataset to get a feeling for how performance compares on different platforms.

After installing the dependencies and compiling the project you can run `npm run benchmark` to run the benchmarks with native code and in node.js. The benchmarks are also available on our demo page to test performance in web browsers.

The benchmarks only consider runtime performance, not load and parse performance.

# What is WebAssembly ?

From [webassembly.org](http://webassembly.org)
> WebAssembly or wasm is a new portable, size- and load-time-efficient format suitable for compilation to the web

WebAssembly is currently supported in the latest stable versions of Chrome / Chromium, Firefox and Safari.
